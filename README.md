# Matrix
A simple matrix class that's compatible with STL functions and CERNs ROOT library. Includes functions for + - * /,  inverting, normalisation, eigenvalues, the trace and transpose.
The whole idea of this repository is to have a reusable class for creating and computing matracies that utilise the abilities of STL and is also compatible with CERNs ROOT library for cpp.
When viewing and/or using the code please keep in mind I am only a fresh grad and not an experienced software dev, I also have fairly limited knowledge with ROOT so any advice or mistakes that you spot please don't hesitate to contact me.
